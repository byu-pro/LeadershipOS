                        <p>Over a multi-decade career, he has served as a <strong>CTO (Platform & API)</strong>,

                            <strong>Architect</strong>, and platform leader across regulated and high-growth
                            environments. His work has focused on designing resilient platforms, durable APIs, and
                            leadership systems that scale without burning out the people responsible for them.</p>
                        <p>Anthony's approach treats leadership as an engineered system rather than a personality trait.
                            Drawing on his background in software architecture, organizational design, and executive
                            leadership, he helps managers move beyond firefighting and into deliberate, repeatable
